## **Automate Code Coverage**

### **Why Automate Code Coverage?**
- Identify untested parts of your codebase.
- Ensure critical paths are tested.

### **How to Automate Code Coverage**

#### **Step 1: Install Coverage Tools**
1. **Python**: Use `coverage.py`:
   ```bash
   pip install coverage
   ```

2. **Node.js**: Use `nyc`:
   ```bash
   npm install nyc --save-dev
   ```

---

#### **Step 2: Run Coverage Reports**
1. **Python**:
   ```bash
   coverage run -m pytest
   coverage report
   ```

2. **Node.js**:
   ```bash
   nyc mocha
   ```

---

#### **Step 3: Automate in CI/CD**
1. ** GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   ```yaml
   name: Code Coverage

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     coverage:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout Code
           uses: actions/checkout@v3

         - name: Install Dependencies
           run: pip install -r requirements.txt

         - name: Run Tests with Coverage
           run: coverage run -m pytest
         - name: Upload Coverage Report
           run: coverage report
   ```
